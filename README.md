# Music City Code 2017 Workshop

This repository hosts the content for the Music City Code 2017 workshop that consists of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), [Couchbase](https://www.couchbase.com), [Angular](https://www.angular.io), and [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org).

For perspective, Node.js will power the backend RESTful API that client facing applications such as Angular and NativeScript use for data consumption. The data will be stored in the NoSQL database, Couchbase. All technologies in this workshop are open source.

## The Requirements

There are many pieces to this project, each with their own set of dependencies. A full set of dependencies include the following:

* Node.js 6.0
* Couchbase Server 4.6
* Android SDK for Android
* Xcode for iOS

The Node Package Manager (NPM) which comes with Node.js will be heavily used for gathering dependencies for Node.js, Angular, and NativeScript. Mobile development with NativeScript allows for deployment to Android as well as iOS, however, the Android SDK must be available and configured as well as Xcode for iOS. Xcode is only available for macOS users.

## The Workshop Breakdown

The workshop is broken down into two core sections, each with their own sub-sections. The two sections consist of an **initial** project and a **complete** project. The instructions in this README will walk you through the development of the **initial** project which will become **complete** as a final result. If at any point in time you'd like to validate your work, find the corresponding sub-section in the **complete** directory.

## Instructions

The **initial** project is broken into four parts, where each part is essentially a different part of the stack.

### Deploying Couchbase and Becoming Familiar with NoSQL

### Building a RESTful API with Node.js and Couchbase Server

### Developing a Client Frontend with Angular

### Bringing the Client Frontend to Android and iOS with NativeScript
